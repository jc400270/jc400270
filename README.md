### Physics Final Exam Review Sheet with Practice Problems


#### 2. [Kinematics](https://openstax.org/books/college-physics-ap-courses-2e/pages/2-1-displacement) & [Projectile Motion](https://openstax.org/books/college-physics-ap-courses-2e/pages/3-4-projectile-motion)

  

**Major Ideas:**

- **Kinematic Equations** (for constant acceleration):

	- $v_f = v_o + at$

	- $\Delta x = v_o t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$

	- $v_{f}^2 = v_{o}^2 + 2a\Delta x$

	- $\Delta x = \frac{1}{2}\left(v_o + v_f\right)t$

- **Projectile Motion**: Motion in two dimensions under gravity. The acceleration in the x-direction is 0.

	- Maximum height, range, and time of flight can be derived using the kinematic equations. Remember at maximum height, $v_y = 0$
	- In cases where $\Delta y = 0$, the horizontal range is given by $\Delta x = \frac{v_{o}^2 \sin{2\theta}}{g}$
	- In cases where $\Delta y \neq 0$, you'll typically solve a quadratic equation in $t$ using y-components of motion in order to find the horizontal range.
	- **Enrico's Face Test**: *If you wouldn't put your face there, the velocity isn't zero!* (Guards against students putting $v_f = 0$ when a projectile hits the ground.


#### 3. Newton's Laws of Motion

  

**Major Ideas:**

- **First Law (Law of Inertia)**: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.

- **Second Law**: $\mathbf{\vec{F}_{net}} = m\mathbf{\vec{a}}$. The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.

- **Third Law**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. (i.e. If I push on you, you're pushing on me with an equal and opposite force, regardless of our relative strength!)

- **Normal Force**: When considering the contact force between two surfaces, this force is directed perpendicular to those surfaces.

- **Friction**: Frictional force is linearly proportional to the normal force. The constant of proportionality is called the *coefficient of friction*, $\mu$. This coefficient is *dimensionless*.

  

#### 4. Uniform Circular Motion and Universal Gravitation

  

**Major Ideas:**

- **Uniform Circular Motion**: Motion in a circle with constant speed.

- Centripetal acceleration: $a_c = \frac{v^2}{r}$

- Centripetal force: $F_c = m \frac{v^2}{r}$

- **Universal Gravitation**:

- Newton's Law of Gravitation: $F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$

- $G$ is the gravitational constant ($6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N}\cdot\text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2$).

- Gravitational force is always attractive and acts along the line joining the centers of two masses.

  

#### 5. Work & Energy Conservation

  

**Major Ideas:**

- **Work**: $W = Fd \cos \theta$, where $F$ is the force, $d$ is the displacement, and $\theta$ is the angle between force and displacement.

- **Kinetic Energy (KE)**: $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$

- **Potential Energy (PE)**:

- Gravitational PE: $PE = mgh$

- Elastic PE (spring): $PE = \frac{1}{2}kx^2$

- **Work-Energy Theorem**: $W

  

= \Delta KE$



#### 6. Momentum

  

**Major Ideas:**

- **Momentum**: $p = mv$, where $m$ is mass and $v$ is velocity.

- **Impulse**: $J = Ft = \Delta p$

- **Conservation of Momentum**: In a closed system, total momentum before collision equals total momentum after collision.

- $m_1v_1 + m_2v_2 = m_1v_1' + m_2v_2'$


#### 7. Thermodynamics

  

**Major Ideas:**

- **Zeroth Law**: If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

- **First Law (Law of Energy Conservation)**: $\Delta U = Q - W$, where $\Delta U$ is the change in internal energy, $Q$ is heat added to the system, and $W$ is work done by the system.

- **Second Law**: Heat flows spontaneously from a hotter body to a colder one. Entropy of an isolated system never decreases.

- **Third Law**: As temperature approaches absolute zero, the entropy of a system approaches a minimum value.
  

#### 8. Coulomb's Law

  

**Major Ideas:**

- **Coulomb's Law**: $F = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$

- $F$ is the force between two charges $q_1$ and $q_2$.

- $r$ is the distance between the charges.

- $k$ is Coulomb's constant ($8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N}\cdot\text{m}^2/\text{C}^2$).

- **Electric Field (E)**: $E = \frac{F}{q} = k \frac{Q}{r^2}$

- Direction of the field is the direction of the force on a positive test charge.
